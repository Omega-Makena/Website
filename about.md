### How I think

I default to constraints: no assumption is sacred unless the data can survive without it. The best architectures are honest about what they do not know, and they fail in visible, reversible ways.

### Origin story (constraint-driven)

- Learned to ship ML with **no paid data** and minimal compute.  
- Built models for **high-regulation environments** where privacy is non-negotiable.  
- Formal training blends **software engineering, quantitative research, and mathematics**—useful when the best answer is an experiment, not a slide deck.

### What I do now

- Design and stress-test the **Scarcity** system for finance and policy work.  
- Mentor women in tech through **Tech-12**, focusing on building reliable instincts with limited resources.  
- Write teaching notes in the **Library** and live logs in the **Research Log** to keep the work transparent.

### Outside research

- Obsessed with **sociology and psychology**—most failures are social, not technical.  
- Replenish by diving into **East Asian storytelling** (manga, manhua, manhwa).  
- Distance running to think; cooking to slow down.

### Direction

Undergrad foundations → quantitative research → ML engineering → system architect. The through-line is making complex systems usable under pressure. If you want to collaborate, **Work With Me** is open for mentorship, consulting, or joint experiments.
