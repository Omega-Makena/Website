# üìù How to Add Blog Posts

## ‚ú® The Simple Way (No Code!)

Your blog posts are **just Markdown files**. Add them to the `posts/` folder and they appear automatically!

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Create a New File

In the `posts/` directory, create a new `.md` file:

```
posts/my-awesome-blog-post.md
```

**File Naming Tips:**
- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens instead of spaces
- Be descriptive: `ai-ethics-2025.md` not `post1.md`
- Date prefixes optional: `2025-10-21-my-post.md`

### 2. Add Frontmatter

At the top of your file, add metadata:

```markdown
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
date: 2025-10-21
category: AI
author: Omega Makena
description: A brief description of your post (shows in blog listing)

---
```

**Required Fields:**
- `title` - Your post title (use quotes if it contains colons `:`)
- `date` - Format: YYYY-MM-DD
- `category` - Must match one from `config.yaml`
- `author` - Your name
- `description` - Brief summary (1-2 sentences)

**Available Categories** (from `config.yaml`):
- Poetry
- AI
- Trends
- Psychology
- Self-Improvement
- Paper Review
- My Papers

### 3. Write Your Content

After the `---`, write your post in Markdown:

```markdown
---

## Your First Heading

Your content here...

### Subsection

More content...

- Bullet points
- Are easy

1. Numbered lists
2. Work too

**Bold text** and *italic text*

[Links work like this](https://example.com)

> Blockquotes for emphasis

```python
# Code blocks with syntax highlighting
def hello():
    print("Hello World!")
```
```

### 4. Add Images (Optional)

```markdown
![Alt text for SEO](/static/img/my-image.jpg)
```

Place images in `static/img/` first.

### 5. Deploy

```bash
python freeze.py
git add posts/my-awesome-blog-post.md
git commit -m "Add blog post: Title"
git push
```

**Done!** Your post is live in 2-3 minutes.

## üìã Complete Example

**File:** `posts/learning-python-tips.md`

```markdown

## Introduction

Learning Python can be overwhelming at first. Here are 10 practical tips that helped me become a better Python developer.

## Tip 1: Start Small

Don't try to learn everything at once. Focus on:
- Basic syntax
- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if/else, loops)

## Tip 2: Practice Daily

```python
# Write code every day, even if it's simple
for day in range(365):
    print(f"Day {day}: Keep coding!")
```

## Tip 3: Read Other People's Code

The best way to learn is by reading quality code. Check out:
- [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
- Open source projects on GitHub
- Well-documented repositories

## Key Takeaways

> "Consistency beats intensity. Code a little every day."

1. Start with fundamentals
2. Practice regularly
3. Learn from others
4. Build real projects

## Conclusion

Python is a journey, not a destination. Keep learning, keep building, and most importantly, enjoy the process!
