- Slower upfront: constraint mapping and simulation add time before shipping.  
- Dependent on honest logging: without real failure notes, the ledger drifts from reality.  
- Sensitive to validation coverage: with sparse data, holdouts can misrepresent production.  
- Requires partner trust: federated setups hinge on governance and transparency.  
- Not a silver bullet: scarcity-aware design cannot replace good data—only make its absence explicit.
