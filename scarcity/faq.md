**Is Scarcity only for finance?**  
No. Finance is the proving ground; the same constraint-led approach applies to macro and policy work.

**Does Scarcity replace data collection?**  
No. It makes lack of data a first-class constraint and designs accordingly.

**How do you validate without pooled data?**  
Federated evaluation partners, synthetic stress tests, and transparent reporting of uncertainty.

**How do you engage?**  
See Work With Me. Collaborations must accept the constraint model and open logging of failures.
