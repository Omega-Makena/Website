**Small Signals**

We build with what is missing:  
noise, blanks, redacted lines.  
Models breathe between the gaps,  
guessing where the data hides.

Some nights the gradients whisper,  
other nights they stall to zero.  
Either way, we listen close—  
there is meaning in the narrow.

When a partner goes offline,  
silence joins the training loop.  
Scarcity is not a threat;  
it is the shape of deeper truth.
