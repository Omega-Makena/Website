# Federated Learning: What It Is, Approaches, Algorithms, and How to Train One

Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables multiple devices or organizations to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging their raw data. Each participant (often called a client) trains a local model on its private dataset and only shares model updates, such as gradients or weights, with a central aggregator or with peers in a decentralized setup. This makes it possible to build high-performing global models while preserving privacy, reducing data transfer, and allowing data to remain distributed where it is generated.

The concept was first popularized by Google in 2016 for applications like Gboard's keyboard prediction, where models are trained across millions of mobile devices. Since then, it has evolved into a powerful framework used in healthcare, finance, IoT systems, and cross-institutional collaborations.

## Why Federated Learning Matters

* **Data privacy:** Sensitive data stays on local devices or servers.
* **Regulatory compliance:** Meets data protection standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.
* **Efficiency:** Reduces central data storage needs.
* **Inclusivity:** Allows participation from different entities with different data types.
* **Scalability:** Supports millions of edge devices with intermittent connectivity.

## How Federated Learning Works (Training Process)

Training a federated learning model typically involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**
   The central server initializes the global model and distributes it to all participating clients.

2. **Local Training**
   Each client trains the model locally on its own data for several epochs.
   Clients use their private datasets to compute model updates (gradients or weight differences).

3. **Model Update Sharing**
   Clients send only their local model updates to the central aggregator.
   No raw data or sensitive information leaves the local environment.

4. **Aggregation (Global Update)**
   The server aggregates all local updates using algorithms such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg).

   * Global weights = weighted average of local weights (weighted by local dataset size).
   * Optionally, secure aggregation methods ensure privacy in this step.

5. **Global Model Distribution**
   The updated global model is redistributed to all clients.
   The process repeats for several rounds until convergence.

6. **Evaluation**
   Clients can evaluate the model locally or share performance metrics to guide further updates.

## Mathematical Overview of FedAvg

If there are *K* clients, each with local data *D_k* and local model parameters *w_k*, then:

**Global model update:**

```
w_{t+1} = Σ(n_k/n) * w_k
```

where *n_k* is the number of samples in client *k*, and *n = Σ n_k* is the total number of samples.

This weighted averaging ensures that larger datasets have more influence on the global model.

## Online and Event-Based Variations

Traditional FL assumes synchronous rounds, but in real-world systems such as economic simulations or IoT devices, data arrives continuously.
For these cases, **Online Federated Learning** or **Event-Based Federated Learning** is used.

* **Online FL:**
  Clients continuously update local models as new data arrives and periodically sync with the server.
  Ideal for streaming or evolving environments.

* **Event-Based FL:**
  Instead of syncing on a fixed schedule, clients trigger updates based on events such as data thresholds, drift detection, or domain activity.
  This approach minimizes unnecessary communication and enables adaptive learning.

These methods are often combined with **meta-learning** or **mixture-of-experts** frameworks for systems that must adapt quickly with minimal data, such as your SCARCITY setup.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Training a Federated Learning Model

1. **Set up environment**

   * Define global and local models (often identical architectures).
   * Choose a communication protocol (centralized or decentralized).

2. **Select clients**

   * Choose participating clients for each round (random subset if large-scale).

3. **Distribute model**

   * Send the global model weights to selected clients.

4. **Local training**

   * Each client trains the model on its private dataset for E epochs.
   * Clients record gradients or parameter differences.

5. **Send updates**

   * Each client sends updates (not data) to the server.

6. **Aggregate updates**

   * The server aggregates using the chosen algorithm (FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdam, etc.).

7. **Update and redistribute**

   * Server updates the global model and sends it back to clients.

8. **Repeat**

   * Repeat until convergence or until desired performance is achieved.

9. **Optional personalization**

   * Fine-tune local models for domain-specific improvements.

## Summary

Federated Learning offers a way to train intelligent systems without violating data privacy.
It shifts learning from centralized data collection to distributed, collaborative optimization.

**Key points to remember:**

* **Core idea:** Train shared models without sharing data.
* **Major approaches:** Horizontal, Vertical, Transfer, Cross-Silo, Cross-Device, and Personalized FL.
* **Algorithms:** FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, FedOpt, FedMeta, and many others designed for heterogeneity and personalization.
* **Training process:** Local updates → aggregation → synchronization → iteration.
* **Extensions:** Event-based, online, hierarchical, and privacy-preserving FL for real-world scalability.

Federated Learning continues to evolve as the foundation for privacy-aware artificial intelligence, enabling collaboration across sectors while maintaining trust, autonomy, and data integrity.
