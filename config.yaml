  bio: |
    <p class="intro font-medium text-lg mb-4">I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a background in Quantitative Research. My work sits at the intersection of software engineering and mathematics, where I focus on architectural efficiency.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">I have a simple philosophy: <strong>Efficiency is everything.</strong> If a process is manual or repetitive, my instinct is to automate it. I enjoy the challenge of taking a messy dataset or a complex mathematical concept and turning it into clean, functioning code.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Currently, I apply these skills to financial data, building models that find signals in the noise. When I'm not staring at a terminal, I'm mentoring the next generation of female tech leaders through <strong>Tech-12</strong>.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Off the clock? I'm fascinated by human behavior (sociology and psychology) and I'm a massive consumer of East Asian storytelling—Manga, Manhua, Manhwa. If you want to talk about AI architecture or the latest plot twist, I'm game.</p>
