# Personal Information

  name: Omega Makena

  location: Kenya
  bio: |
    <p class="intro">I'm a quantitative researcher with a strong machine learning background. I like building things that think and do things for me. If a task takes one second to do, I'd still rather spend centuries coding something that can do it for me, because why not?</p>
    <p>I'm super passionate about artificial intelligence, probably a little crazy about it. I could talk about AI for a millennium if you let me. It's not just an interest anymore; it's an ongoing obsession that somehow keeps getting worse (or better, depending on who you ask).</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I mentor young girls in Kenya through <strong>Tech-12</strong>, an organization focused on bridging the gender gap in tech and helping STEM actually make sense to young women who have been told it's not for them.</p>
    <p>For someone who claims to obsess over artificial intelligence, I surprisingly have other interests. I'm fascinated by human beings: psychology, physiology, sociology, anthropology, basically the whole "why do we act the way we act" question. That's another obsession of mine.</p>
    <p>Outside of that, I'm a very typical nerd. I'm obsessed with anime: Chinese (<em>manhua</em>), Japanese (<em>manga</em>), and South Korean (<em>manhwa</em>). Sometimes I mix them up, but it's fine.</p>
    <p class="outro">So yeah, that's me. Enjoy my portfolio.</p>
