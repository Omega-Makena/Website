# How to Add Projects to Your Website

This guide explains how to add new projects to your portfolio **without touching the Python code**.

## üìù Adding a New Project

### Step 1: Create a YAML File

1. Navigate to the `projects/` directory
2. Create a new file named `your-project-name.yaml`
3. Use the template below:

```yaml
title: Your Project Title
description: A clear, compelling description of your project (1-2 sentences)
tech:
  - Python
  - React
  - Docker
  - PostgreSQL
live_url: https://your-project-demo.com
github_url: https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo
image: your-project-image.jpg
order: 3
featured: true
```

### Step 2: Add Project Image (Optional)

1. Place your project image in `static/img/`
2. Use the filename you specified in the `image` field
3. Recommended size: 800x600px or 16:9 aspect ratio

### Step 3: Deploy

That's it! Your project will automatically appear on your portfolio page.

For local testing:
```bash
python app.py
```

For deployment:
```bash
python freeze.py
git add .
git commit -m "Add new project"
git push
```

## üí° Tips

### Project Order
- Projects are sorted by the `order` field (lowest first)
- If no `order` is specified, projects are sorted alphabetically by title
- Use gaps (1, 10, 20, 30) to easily insert projects later

### Technology Stack
- List technologies in order of importance
- Keep it to 4-6 items for visual appeal
- Use common, recognizable names (e.g., "React" not "React.js")

### Descriptions
- Keep it concise (1-2 sentences, ~150 characters)
- Focus on impact and results
- Avoid technical jargon unless necessary

### Images
- Use high-quality images (800x600px minimum)
- Maintain consistent aspect ratio (16:9 recommended)
- Optimize file size (<500KB)
- PNG or JPG format

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

1. **Incorrect YAML syntax**
   - Use spaces, not tabs for indentation
   - Use 2 spaces for nested items
   - Keep array items aligned

2. **Missing image files**
   - Make sure image exists in `static/img/`
   - Check filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)

3. **Invalid URLs**
   - Include `https://` prefix
   - Test links before deploying

4. **Too many technologies**
   - Limit to 4-6 key technologies
   - Focus on primary stack

## üîÑ Updating Existing Projects

1. Open the project's YAML file in `projects/`
2. Edit any field
3. Save the file
4. Redeploy: `python freeze.py` and push to GitHub

## üóëÔ∏è Removing Projects

Simply delete the project's YAML file from the `projects/` directory and redeploy.
