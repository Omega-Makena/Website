question: Can a federated model survive intermittent participation from small brokerages and still deliver stable signals?
decision: Build a minimal aggregator with adaptive weighting and simulate dropouts before onboarding real partners.

**Question**

Retail brokerages have uneven traffic and strict privacy boundaries. Can a federated model learn a stable signal without relying on any single participant?

**Decision**

- Use a simple FedAvg baseline with reliability-weighted updates (participation rate + recency).  
- Start with synthetic clients that mimic real volume patterns before touching production data.  
- Reserve a thin validation stream from one broker willing to share anonymized aggregates for evaluation only.

**Failure (so far)**

- Early simulations collapsed when a high-volume client went silent; the weighting scheme still over-trusted its last update.  
- Communication overhead was higher than expected because payload compression was skipped for speed.  
- Evaluation drifted because the validation stream did not represent weekend/holiday behavior.

**Next uncertainty**

- How much personalization per brokerage is needed before the global model stops overreacting?  
- What governance do partners need to trust the aggregation loop?  
- Does a meta-learning warm start outperform fine-tuning given the participation gaps?
