title: "Phase 1: Site Launch & Scarcity Integration"
description: We made the website, pushed Scarcity, and redesigned the interface. Documentation is now up to date.

question: How do we present complex infrastructure with clarity and distinctiveness?
decision: Adopted 'Analog Academic' aesthetic with Glassmorphism to unify the content.

**1. Website Initialization**

We established the core platform structure. The goal was to create a home for **Omega Labs** that reflects our quantitative and engineering focus.

**2. Scarcity Framework Push**

The `code2` repository content (MPIE, DRG, Federation) has been pushed and integrated. The [Scarcity](/scarcity/) page now accurately reflects the architecture of the framework version `0.4.0-beta`.

**3. Design Overhaul (Log Redesign)**

We iterated through several visual systems before landing on the **"Analog Academic"**:
- **Watermark**: Uses the `omega-labs.jpg` signal as a background anchor.
- **Glassmorphism**: Cards uses a frosted glass effect (`backdrop-blur`) to allow the texture to breathe.
- **Hub Layouts**: Both **Lab Notes** and **Scarcity** now use a "Card Hub" directory structure for better navigation.

**4. Documentation & Writing**

All documentation has been reviewed. The focus was on ensuring everything is "well written" and up to date with the repo state.

**Next Steps**

With the foundation solid and documentation accurate, we move to **Actual Testing** of the Scarcity framework components in the simulation engine.
