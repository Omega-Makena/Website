## Overview

A comprehensive implementation of SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models for time series forecasting. This project demonstrates advanced techniques in model selection, parameter optimization, and validation.

## Methodology

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identifying trends, seasonality, and stationarity
- **Model Selection**: Automated AIC/BIC comparison for optimal parameters
- **Validation**: Walk-forward validation with confidence intervals
- **Forecasting**: Multi-step ahead predictions with uncertainty quantification

## Model Performance

The SARIMA implementation achieved superior accuracy compared to baseline models, with MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) under 5% for most test cases. The model effectively captures both short-term dynamics and seasonal patterns.

## Key Features

- Automated parameter selection using grid search
- Robust handling of missing data
- Comprehensive diagnostic tools
- Visualization suite for model interpretation

## Applications

This forecasting framework has been applied to various domains including sales forecasting, demand planning, and resource allocation.
