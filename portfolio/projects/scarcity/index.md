## Overview

This research project develops a computational framework for understanding and simulating scarcity dynamics in complex systems. The framework provides insights into resource allocation, competitive behaviors, and potential interventions.

## Research Objectives

- Model scarcity dynamics in real-world contexts
- Simulate various policy interventions
- Quantify the impact of different allocation strategies
- Provide actionable recommendations for decision-makers

## Architecture

The framework consists of multiple interconnected modules:

- **Environment Modeler**: Defines the resource landscape
- **Agent System**: Simulates individual behaviors
- **Policy Engine**: Tests different intervention strategies
- **Analytics Layer**: Provides visualization and insights

## Key Insights

Simulations revealed that early intervention strategies have disproportionate positive impacts compared to reactive measures. The framework is now being used in policy planning for resource management.

## Repository
