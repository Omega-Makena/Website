## Overview

This project explores how basic economic rules play out in a closed system. The goal was to write a simulation where different entities interact—buying, selling, and trading—to see if realistic price trends and market behaviors would emerge naturally from the code. It was a deep dive into complex logic and algorithmic design.

## Research Objectives

- Model scarcity dynamics in real-world contexts
- Simulate various policy interventions
- Quantify the impact of different allocation strategies
- Provide actionable recommendations for decision-makers

## Architecture

The framework consists of multiple interconnected modules:

- **Environment Modeler**: Defines the resource landscape
- **Entity System**: Simulates individual behaviors and interactions
- **Policy Engine**: Tests different intervention strategies
- **Analytics Layer**: Provides visualization and insights

## Key Insights

Simulations revealed that early intervention strategies have disproportionate positive impacts compared to reactive measures. The framework is now being used in policy planning for resource management.
