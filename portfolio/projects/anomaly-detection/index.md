## Overview

An advanced anomaly detection system combining multiple algorithms to identify outliers with high precision and recall. The system is designed for production use with real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Approach

The framework employs an ensemble of detection methods:

- **Isolation Forest**: Fast anomaly detection in high-dimensional spaces
- **One-Class SVM**: Boundary-based outlier identification
- **Autoencoders**: Deep learning approach for complex patterns
- **Statistical Methods**: Z-score and modified Z-score analysis

## Performance Metrics

The ensemble approach achieves:
- **Precision**: 96.5%
- **Recall**: 94.2%
- **F1-Score**: 95.3%
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.98

## Real-World Applications

Successfully deployed for:
- Fraud detection in financial transactions
- Quality control in manufacturing
- Network intrusion detection
- Medical diagnostic anomaly identification

## Innovation

The key innovation is an adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts sensitivity based on data distribution changes, ensuring consistent performance over time.
