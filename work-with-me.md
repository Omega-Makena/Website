### How we can work together

**Mentoring**  
1:1 guidance for engineers and researchers who want to ship under constraints—architecture reviews, experiment design, or career direction. Short, focused sessions.

**Consulting / Freelance**  
Designing and delivering ML systems where data is limited or regulated. Expect a constraint ledger, a testable plan, and transparency on risks.

**Collaboration**  
Academic or open-source projects that align with Scarcity. I co-design experiments, run simulations, and document failure openly.

### What to expect
- Calm, no-hype communication.  
- Written summaries after sessions.  
- Pushback when assumptions are weak.  
- Measurable outcomes and a debrief on what worked and what did not.
